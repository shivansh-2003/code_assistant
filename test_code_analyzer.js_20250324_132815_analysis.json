    "Improve naming conventions by using camelCase for variables and function names consistently. Refactor poorly named functions and classes.",
    "Break down long functions like 'processUserData' into smaller, more modular functions to improve readability and maintainability.",
    "Enhance code documentation by adding meaningful comments and docstrings to all functions and classes. Aim for at least one comment per function.",
    "Standardize code formatting by consistently applying proper indentation, spacing, and semicolon usage throughout the codebase.",
    "Promote reusability by refactoring repetitive code in 'calculatePrices' function to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.",
    "Adopt JavaScript best practices such as using const/let instead of var, === instead of ==, arrow functions for callbacks, template literals for string formatting, and try/catch for error handling."
